  <h3> The Art of Asking Questions </h3>
  <p><SPAN STYLE = "margin-left: 30px">
 believe one of the more daunting challenges I have at times where I’m learning new material with unfamiliar terminology is asking direct questions that get to the point and clarify what I need to know. I think part of the reason for this could be confidence with new material, I tend to over-simplify questions when I should be more specific and direct. One thing I can definitely work on for questions through email or postings is to make a clear and descriptive subject line, I fall into the category of making a general subject so that its hard for others to immediately digest what it is i’m asking.
  Another important part of asking technical questions is providing feedback to anyone involved in helping solving the problem, this makes it easier to learn from other users and develop a stronger understanding of the subject matter.
  A great rule to follow and one that  I will keep in mind is to imagine I was the one answering the question, I can remember answering questions that  I believed to be confusing and hard to understand and it really limited my ability to answer the question in an effective and confident manner. Another technique I will have in mind will be to use illustrations to make the question as descriptive in possible, this could be a simplified line of code for a general question or a specific line of code when trying to figure out the source of an error.
  These are just a few of the methods I will attempt to incorporate into my programming education given the importance of asking efficient and direct questions.
