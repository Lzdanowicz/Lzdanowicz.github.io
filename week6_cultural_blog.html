                       Stereo-type threat is a social psychology topic in where people are at risk of confirming negative stereo types of their social groups. it is a social situation where one might be negatively effected in many ways. Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lea to a circle of diminished confidence within the individual. This is a very imprint subject to be mindful about in an academic setting. I believe truthful and positive feedback is important to avoiding stereotype threat. You want to give feedback to others that has a strong focus on their strengths but also an objective look at what they could do better. Communication is a very important factor when looking at stereotype threat and its effects on individuals.
