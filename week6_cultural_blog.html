                      Stereo-type threat is a social psychology topic in where people are at risk of confirming negative stereo types of their social groups. It is not something that I have thought of often as a problem in social settings so after researching the idea, I quickly became surprised as to the instances in which I have witnessed the problem effect those around me and even myself in certain circumstances. One of the very surprising factors that I discovered through research on the topic is that Stereo-type threat can go as far as actually reducing working memory resources which has a significant impact on intellectual tasks. Because everybody belongs to some type of group that is identified by a stereo-type, virtually anybody can be effected by it. Having this knowledge on the mechanics of Stereo-type will make me more aware and responsive going forward in any type of challenge going forward where I am evaluated. There are several effective methods for reducing the effect of Stereo-type threat, one of the most important being Deemphasizing threatened social identities by mentally re-framing oneself in a way that focuses on individual valued characteristics, studies have shows that students in certain social groups perform better when they are shown contextual clues giving positive reinforcement over their individual group status.
