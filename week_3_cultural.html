  <h3> ThinkStyle (End of Unit 1) </h3>


  <p> In the last 3 weeks of Unit-1 I have been challenged in a way that I haven't been used to in recent years. The DBC experience takes some adjusting to given it is not an environment that feeds you information to process rather you learn by doing, mistakes are inevitable and even central to the learning experience. My biggest Challenge is likely putting off concepts that seem difficult for me to pick up quicky, I learned this lesson the hard way in the past week of Javascript where I would find myself avoiding challenges that exposed my limitations within the language. This is probably my biggest challenge overall as I put off concepts I have difficulty with and it doesn't give me much room to get outside help. I also find that I can shy away from exploring concepts that expose my limitations when I'm in a pairing environment, personally it can be hard to let me guard down because I don't want my partner to judge me for any holes in my knowledge which limits my ability to get the most out of the sessions. I think I have been marginally improving these challenges over the coarse of the first 3 weeks but still have a way to go. I think letting my guard down around others in a group environment and exposing my ignorance will only help to get the most of my learning and expereince.   </p>
