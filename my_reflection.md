## 6. Beginning HTML Reflection

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?

The way that the syntax is setup in HTML is very straightforward and easy to learn. I found it easy to think about the big picture in the planning phase of building the berkshire website. Some processes such as making lists seemed very unnecessary so I'm guessing there are shortcuts in the upcoming sections.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: Easier to read general syntax of HTML code than other languages I have been introduced to, many concepts seem to be repeated often which is good for recognizing patterns.

Bad: Things are repetitive, at least from the way I did it, creating something like a list took a good amount of time to replicate simple paragraphs.

- Did you have an "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?

Probably putting together a basic site with a few different elements for the first time, solidified the overall structure of how HTML syntax is put together, it also helped to play around and try new things to get comfortable with different changes.


- Have you had experience before with HTML/CSS if so how much experience? If not how hard did you feel it was to learn?
I took an introduction class to HTML is college, so much of the work here was a nice refresher, I find it easier than a language like Ruby where everything is new to me and the syntax is a bit more cryptic.


- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I worked with someone on these releases who was very good at explaining a few topics I originally didn't grasp such as the use of <div>
