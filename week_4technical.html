                    <p>
                        An Array is a data structure in ruby that is used to hold information. It is simple to understand as it is a list of different values. These values can be of different classes, so for example and array can contain a mix of integers and strings such as 4 and “Four”. Each individual element within an array so (4) as an example can be located by it’s position within the array. The first element in an array is indexed as (0), every element following the initial has a progressively increasing (+1) index value. The index value can then be referred when using certain values within the array, we can iterate within the values of the area over a specified value of ranges. Arrays are best used when we have a group of data that is all relatable to the same context; for example a list of test scores on the exam. It gives us a variety of ways to manipulate or read into the data that were given, we can order the data using the sort function or iterate over the array to determine the quantity of a given letter grade. It could be difficult to use and array if we want to have a value within the array assigned to a independent variable, in this case a hash might be a better use of a data structure in that it offers the ability to assign keys which act as symbols for the independent value.
