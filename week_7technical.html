                        SQL injection focuses on  a coding technique used to attack data-driven applications. Malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. This allows the attacker to gain access to the entrees within the database. An attacker can usually do this by exploiting a security vulnerability in an applications software. As applications carry more and more data pertaining to their users, SQL injection is a major problem within the technological community. Incorrectly filtered escape characters seem to be a major implementation of SQL injection, this occurs when user input is not filtered for escape characters and is then passed into a SQL statement, in other words something within the users actual data may create an escape character that results in manipulation of the statements used to run the application. NoSQL is another type of database that stores information differently. Instead of using tables with columns to hold sets of information, NoSQL uses a collection of key-value pairs. This gives a NoSQL database the ability to by dynamic and constantly changing. NoSQL are also horizontally scalable as opposed to SQL which is a vertically scalable database, this makes it easier to store large sets of data within NoSQL.
