                        Pairing thus far in my DBC journey has been a very positive experience. I was nervous before my first session and questioned whether pairing would be a very efficient way to tackle challenges. I was surprised within my first few pairing sessions that communicating every step of the problem helps develop my knowledge of code and thinking in general. Observing how others think through the coding process and develop ideas is also very interesting, as a driver on these challenges I find it extremely enlightening when my partner navigates a challenge in a way that I would have never thought of on my own, I think that might have been the most rewarding part of several challenges. 
	Feedback on the pairing sessions is great, I like that feedback I have gotten gives me specific things I can adapt going forward. I also feel very positive after reading the feedback from my pairing partners, positive feedback regarding my coding ability and communication is very motivating and assuring which is critical in an environment where there are a lot of new challenges that can bring a lot of frustration. Writing feedback made me really think through the session and go over different things we did that were positive as well as things that could have been better. I enjoy letting my partner know they were a positive influence on my learning and stating the specific ways they helped me progress.
