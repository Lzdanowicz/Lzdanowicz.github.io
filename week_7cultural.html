                    <p>
                     Self-knowledge is a value that is very important to me and something I use to access my progress as I move forward with all of life’s challenges. As someone who reflects often and documents different thought patterns over time, I strongly value the ability to understand myself within a bigger context even though it is difficult to conquer your own ego at times. I would strongly agree that I try to live up to these values, for me self-enhancement is something that I always try to keep in mind and Self-knowledge plays a central role in developing one’s self. Earlier today an old co-worker asked for advice pertaining to taking on a career change, likely due to the fact I made that very leap. I think it does somewhat relate to my values as far as being aware of where you currently are in respect to where you see yourself sometime in the future.
