                        Classes are the building blocks for objects within ruby. They define what an object has the capability to do within the ruby language. There are basic strings within ruby that have characteristics and methods built in within them such as arrays and strings, this allows programmers to quickly create these objects and develop them within the basic functions assigned to them. Being able to write our own classes and even adapting them overtime is the cornerstone function for object orientated programming. When writing a class it is important to have a very clear idea as to what you want your objects to perform and how it relates to the overall objective of a program. Things that an object is able to do, are referred to as methods. Methods within certain classes separate written objects from basic level objects that you can create via Object.new. Classes can also have sub-classes within them, where in the sub-class inherits the methods used in the parent class. Classes can also contain other classes within them. Understanding the principles of this centerpiece ruby object is essential for building object orientated programs.
